# Neural Style Transfer Demo

> In this project implements a the neural style transfer from an arbitrary image

> Details on the algorithm can found here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576" target="_blank"> Leon A. Gatys' paper, A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style </a>

> Code inspired from the following <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/nst_blogpost/4_Neural_Style_Transfer_with_Eager_Execution.ipynb" target="_blank">tensorflow codelab</a>

**Notes**

- based on tensoflow 1.x
- make use opencv
- accept arguments for input/output/style images
- accept arguments for styling weights
